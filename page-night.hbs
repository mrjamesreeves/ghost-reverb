                    <p>"Memorial artworks are notoriously difficult to pull off. Yet Candy Chang and James A. Reeves, two New York artists who have created similar installations in the past, hit just the right tone with After the End, a participatory work in the Historic Chapel at Green-Wood Cemetery."</p>
                    <cite>—The New York Times</cite>
                    <p>“The inspiration is so simple: Head out at random into America and see what you find. James A. Reeves found the America no one seems to be looking for anymore, and he also found himself."</p>

                <div class="about-press-column">
                    <p>"Through his photographs and candid, episodic storytelling, Reeves documents his experiences and the people he encounters in various regions of the United States, reflecting with uncommon honesty on both positive and negative aspects of the culture. Reeves's obsession with driving long distances in rental cars is fueled by his search to figure out what it means to be an adult and to live a meaningful life in a complicated world."</p>

                <div class="about-press-column">
                    <p>"A tantalizing 21st-century cross between James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men and Jack Kerouac's On the Road, this remarkable and utterly original memoir heralds the arrival of a new and important American voice. James A. Reeves's The Road to Somewhere will take you places you will not easily forget."</p>
