          <p>When a mysterious sound rips through a Las Vegas superstore and delivers disturbing visions to the shoppers inside, it splits them into believers and skeptics—and saints and killers.</p>
          <p>Mixing cosmic horror with the painfully human desire for answers, <em><strong>Static</strong></em> is an eight-episode series that welds the spiritualized concerns of <em>The Leftovers</em> to a <em>Fugitive</em>-style thriller.</p>
          <p>This neon-soaked mystery invites viewers to speculate on the sound&rsquo;s origins alongside characters who go down very different roads as they search for meaning in a fallen world. Some will fight to restore what was lost, while others think it&rsquo;s time to clear the stage for a better show.</p>

          <p>There&rsquo;s a hum in the distance, and a few shoppers cock their heads, thinking it might be a siren or some machinery on the fritz. Then the sliding doors shatter, and a vicious frequency howls through the superstore, a teeth-grinding drone that rearranges the lives of everyone inside.</p>
          <p>A cab driver sees the bloody wreckage of her past. A cashier is tormented by the love he abandoned. An internet superstar receives a message from beyond. Seventy-one customers are vacant-eyed and swaying, teetering on the edge of the unknown. A lucky few experience visions of transcendence, even revelation—but not the priest who cowers in the frozen food aisle, horrified by a childhood monster that has come to life.</p>
          <p>When the cameras arrive, the survivors provide conflicting accounts as they shiver beneath shock blankets, saying it was the sound of a dial tone or maybe a demon. Some think it&rsquo;s a new form of weather. Others say it&rsquo;s the latest style of terror. And a growing number are beginning to believe it&rsquo;s the voice of God.</p>
          <p>The cab driver thinks it was just her imagination until she hears a voice in the radio static, and it sounds just like her daughter who died in a baffling accident six years ago.</p>

        <div class="glass-panel">
          <p>As the otherworldly sound fades into the Vegas night, a cab driver (KAY, 60s) flees the scene. She&rsquo;s got an outstanding warrant and, more importantly, she&rsquo;s seen what superstition does to people, and it&rsquo;s not pretty. But then she hears her daughter (CARLY DEE, 30s) on the radio, a one-hit-wonder who died in an infamous accident—and she&rsquo;s calling out for her mother.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a charismatic priest (FATHER JIM, 40s) who thinks God mocked him in the superstore, will retreat into the desert and conjure a new religion from the footage of a sitcom. He becomes obsessed with rewinding time and restoring order to his world, and he&rsquo;ll start by proving the sound was a hallucination and nothing more.</p>
          <p>As the ruins of the store become a makeshift town for the survivors and the curious alike, a cashier (EDDIE, 30s) will transform his grief into a gift. Two internet celebrities (SILVER and GOLD, 20s) will profoundly diverge as they search for answers. And a man known only as THE MANAGER (30s) will purchase the property, hoping people will gamble on an encounter with the divine.</p>

          <p>Like a modern-day siren, Carly Dee&rsquo;s voice in the static will draw these people into a world where the familiar becomes unreal, a world of ceremonial car crashes and horrifying makeup tutorials, of crowds laying down on the interstate and towers of home appliances looming above the sprawl. A line from a ballad becomes a prophecy—<em>you can hear better in the dark</em>—and, as Carly Dee&rsquo;s devotees gather to await the return of the Great Frequency, the lights of Vegas begin to flicker.</p>
          <p>If Kay wants to reach her daughter and reveal the mystery of the Great Frequency, she must reckon with her own dark past. And she will need everyone&rsquo;s help to stop Father Jim, who is determined to remove all evidence of the sound—and destroy anyone who&rsquo;s heard it.</p>

          <p class="character__age">60s</p>
          <p>A jittery and sharp-tongued Taiwanese-American woman, Kay grinds away in the gig economy, ferrying drunks around Vegas at night and scrubbing images from the internet during the day.</p>
          <p>She&rsquo;s seen what humanity has to offer, and she knows there&rsquo;s nothing worth believing in, not on this planet or anywhere else. Of course she&rsquo;s resentful: she&rsquo;d been a star in her youth, an Olympic diver whose dreams were cut short by tragedy after tragedy, culminating in her daughter&rsquo;s death six years ago. But she won&rsquo;t talk about her past or even tell you her real name. If she did, she might have to explain why her daughter hated her—and why she sometimes sees an old man falling from the sky.</p>
          <p>Now her dead daughter is on the radio, claiming responsibility for the otherworldly sound that haunts the shoppers at a superstore. As Kay searches for the source of her child&rsquo;s voice, she will become a fugitive, drawn into a world of bizarre rituals and the glare of television cameras. This cynical woman who spent her life keeping her head down, believing in nothing, will find herself becoming a leader. But if she wants to save her new community, she&rsquo;ll need to face up to her past—and atone.</p>

          <p>A chatty priest from New Orleans with a smile that could charm the devil, Father Jim is beloved by his community—and he loves being their leader. After encountering pure evil as a child, he&rsquo;s spent fifty years on the righteous path, and he knows he&rsquo;s right with God. He&rsquo;d always imagined that if the moment ever came, he&rsquo;d be first in line to receive divine judgment, and he would do it with his eyes cast up to heaven, ready to take his place in the drama of the ancients. But now the Lord has played him for a fool, leaving him writhing in torment while others experienced holy ecstasy.</p>
          <p>Although his faith has been shattered, Father Jim will pick up the pieces, the few he can find anyway, and he will conjure a new and better God, one who guides him to a new flock in the most unlikely of places. And he will transform an old sitcom into a gospel that will lead him towards the very evil that fascinated him as a boy: a creature in the shadows, swinging a massive mallet and hunting for anything that might bleed.</p>

          <p>Kay&rsquo;s daughter had been a happy girl who dreamed of seeing her name in lights. But she was forever changed the night an otherworldly sound filled her head on a remote Iowa road. When her mother denied it happened, Carly Dee ran away as soon as she could, determined to find some answers. Instead, she found a career as an avant-garde rock-n-roller who invented &ldquo;celestial metal&rdquo; and became a one-hit-wonder with a song about how &ldquo;you can hear better in the dark.&rdquo; But if she&rsquo;s remembered at all these days, it&rsquo;s only as &ldquo;the girl in the car&rdquo; when a beloved actor-turned-politician plowed his Cadillac into a boulder, killing them both.</p>
          <p>Some of her die-hard fans think she&rsquo;s the voice on the radio, the mysterious woman known as the Voice of the Red Rocks who hijacked the airwaves and predicted the cosmic sound that tore up a Vegas superstore. She&rsquo;s being hailed as a prophet, even if she died six years ago. Is she a ghost in the machine, leading the desperate and damaged into a dangerous new faith? Is she really causing the lights of Vegas to flicker? Carly Dee is our Colonel Kurtz in <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, the riddle in the shadows that will draw her mother up the river into a confrontation that might turn out the lights for good.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know what time it is!&rdquo; Cut to a mischievous grin as sixteen-year-old Tanner Whitney delivers his famous catchphrase on <em>Family Therapy</em>, the sitcom everyone knows, even if they never watched it intentionally. Whitney was a child star who became a national sensation when he traded the soundstage for the soapbox, summoning the energy of Bobby Kennedy on cocaine as he beamed before rapt crowds who chanted, &ldquo;We <em>know</em> what time it is!&rdquo; Then he met a notorious musician named Carly Dee. Later that night, his car was found wrapped around a boulder in the desert.</p>
          <p>The tragic end of Tanner Whitney&rsquo;s life has transformed him into a myth. But some folks refuse to let him go. <em>That wasn&rsquo;t his body,</em> they say. <em>The funeral was a deep-fake.</em> Every Sunday night, they gather in the desert to reenact Whitney&rsquo;s last moments and marvel at the airbag that, like the Veil of Veronica, bears an imprint of his face.</p>
          <p>And then one night, an odd priest interrupts this ritual and begins to reshape Whitney&rsquo;s image—and the footage from his TV show—into a frightening weapon in a war against God.</p>

And Kay will discover the ghost of her daughter, Carly Dee, has been hijacking the airwaves, predicting &ldquo;the Great Frequency&rdquo;—and some think she&rsquo;s a prophet.</p>

              <h4>ACT II: The Ballad</h4>
              <p>Episodes 4-6 find our characters returning to the ruins of the superstore after failing to reconnect with their lives &ldquo;before.&rdquo; A makeshift town emerges, thanks to the benevolence of the new owner, a mysterious investor who bought the place in cash. Despite wanting to remain a loner, Kay finds herself becoming a leader—until Carly Dee broadcasts Kay&rsquo;s dark past for everyone to hear. Silver will leave Kay&rsquo;s side to join Carly Dee&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadows.&rdquo; As she gathers a larger and more fervent flock, we will delve into Carly Dee&rsquo;s story—and perhaps take her side against her mother. Meanwhile, Father Jim is hoping for a great reset, and he&rsquo;s determined to erase everyone who&rsquo;s heard the sound.</p>

              <h4>ACT III: The Tower</h4>
              <p>Episodes 7-8 bring us into the monastery of Carly Dee&rsquo;s shadows. A strip mall transformed into the opposite of Kay&rsquo;s shabby community at the superstore, it&rsquo;s a stark yet functional society of ascetic ritual that has turned its back on the modern world. Meanwhile, Gold&rsquo;s media empire and Father Jim&rsquo;s flock fuse into a powerful new force. Soon these factions will be drawn towards a climax that finds a frightening army bearing down upon Kay&rsquo;s new community, forcing her to atone for her past before she can enlist the help of others. As the lights of Vegas flicker, she must summon her daughter so she can stop this madness before the lights go out forever.</p>

          <h4 class="location-sub">Las Vegas</h4>
          <p>A hallucinatory city where people gather to exploit each other and be exploited—what better place to explore the collision between our darkest urges and our desire for meaning? The Strip will remain a throb in the distance; we&rsquo;re more interested in the fringes of the sprawl, where Vegas has become a polyglot church of strip malls, jumbotrons, night markets, and ad-hoc communities from all corners of the world.</p>

          <h4 class="location-sub">The Mojave Desert</h4>
          <p>Since the beginning of history, the desert has been the home of revelation, a geography of desperate saints and ascetics dragging themselves across the sand in search of salvation. This energy reverberates through today&rsquo;s American desert, where airplane graveyards glint in the sun, people search the sky for flying saucers, and there&rsquo;s a woman who can tell your future by deciphering the contrails of military aircraft.</p>

          <p>Our story unfolds along the borderlands of the city and the desert, where streetlights give way to darkness. We will spend most of our time in three locations:</p>
          <div class="location-body">
            <h4 class="location-sub">The Superstore</h4>
            <p>A standard-issue big-box store with acreage of products, this is our home base. It will be intact at the beginning of the pilot before it&rsquo;s destroyed by panic and fire. Throughout the series, some of our characters will transform the ruins into a shelter, then a community, and eventually a home they&rsquo;ll need to defend.</p>
            <h4 class="location-sub">The Parking Lot</h4>
            <p>Here is the rest of the world: the news crews, government authorities, scientists, zealots, gawkers, merchants, faith-dealers, and hedonists. It&rsquo;s a holy place and a media circus, a modern-day temple fused with the energy of a bacchanalian night market, and a site of contention.</p>
            <h4 class="location-sub">The Barn</h4>
            <p>A neon-lit barn sits next to a boulder in the Mojave desert. This is the site of The Last Ride of Tanner Whitney, a strange underground ritual dedicated to a celebrity car wreck—until it becomes the church of a fallen priest.</p>
