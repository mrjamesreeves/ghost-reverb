# February 2026

### Sunday, February 1
Or maybe today is the day I thought I saw an Alp poking through the clouds. We checked into a suprisingly spacious room on Albertinaplatz with cozy window nooks and took naps. Ate dumplings and fried rice at a decent Chinese spot on Krugerstraße, then I sat in the window nook and finished the 39th episode of Midnight Radio.

Thirteen years sober and another year older. Eggs florentine and a day at the Albertina, a former palace filled with gilded halls that might have once seemed opulent but now felt like totalitorian kitsch thanks to the taste of my country’s current president. I was struck by a description of an artist’s work as “representing nostalgic landscapes of the sould.” Perhaps one day I will read Kandinsky’s <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>.
