# February 2026

### Sunday, February 1
Or maybe today is the day I thought I saw an Alp poking through the clouds. We checked into a suprisingly spacious room on Albertinaplatz with cozy window nooks. Napped. Ate dumplings and fried rice at a decent Chinese spot on Krugerstraße, then I sat in the alcove overlooking the drizzly square and finished the 39th episode of Midnight Radio.

Thirteen years sober and another year older. Eggs florentine and a day at the Albertina, a former palace filled with gilded halls that might have once seemed opulent but now felt like totalitorian kitsch thanks to the taste of my country’s current president. I was struck by a description of <a href=“https://sammlungenonline.albertina.at/en/objects/details/351377”>Franz Sedlacek’s paintings</a> as “representing nostalgic landscapes of the soul.” 

Perhaps one day I will read Kandinsky’s <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>, but the real action is the yellow shock of <a href=“https://bsky.app/profile/jamesreeves.co/post/3mduusmvzak26”>Max Ernst’s flowers</a>. Why does painting move me more than sculpture or drawing or photography? 

Dinner at a dim sum joint crammed with so many Chinese people I briefly thought we were back in Taipei. Two orders of dumplings and some chili oil noodles while we talked about self-punishment and perfectionism as mutations of the ego.

Apricot crepes for breakfast at Cafe Tirolerhof, an ancient parlor with vivid upholstery and elderly people nursing cakes and newspapers. Onwards to the Kunsthistorische Museum to see some big-budget Bruegel: the high drama of the Procession to Calvary and the tower of Babel. Scenes of peasant feasts, Saul’s suicide, and hunters tromping through the snow. But most of all I was struck by Bruegel’s <em>Fight Between Carnival and Lent</em>, a fantastically deranged scene that captures the blurry line between the sacred and profane.

We came across two more unhappy portraits of Lot and his daughters, a scene that continues to baffle C. and me. Who was this painted for? Sometimes it’s like body horror: all the globs of cherubs in the sky, the bloodied torso of Christ and penitent saints, all the bare-breasted women—there’s just so much flesh at the museum. Or a fever dream captioned with phrases like: “The child playing with an inflated bladder is a reference to the brevity of life.”

Sitting on a bench among gigantic baroque scenes of flagellations and fishmongers, I finally clocked the cinematic nature of painting. Perhaps because C was sitting next to me, saying “It feels like watching movies.” But I’d never considered the artist as a director, each deciding upon the key climactic moment for Cleopatra’s suicide or Judith’s beheading of Holofernes.

So many baroque meals with cozy cakes. A supper of lobster brioche and a trough of mussels. I’m getting fat in Vienna but I dug the tranquility of a dozen cafe lights reflected and multiplied in the window while, outside, people hurry through the February gloom.

### Wednesday, February 4
Here in Vienna, there’s a severe weather alert for “glazed frost”—which sounds very Viennese. But straight to the Belvedere to deal with Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, both of whom I’ve misunderstood. Somehow I was not aware of Klimt’s <em>The Kiss</em>, which C finds hard to believe because it wallpapered many dorm rooms alongside Monet’s water lilies. But I never spent much time in those rooms. Klimt’s real masterpiece is his rendering of Judith with an expression so seductive, relaxed, and defiant that the severed head she cradles becomes an afterthought. Maybe it comes down to the gleam of her teeth. Klimt’s work pulls off an interesting feat: flat and graphic yet somehow bathed in atmosphere and light. 

I was startled to discover Schiele had left behind so many distinctive lines before his death at 28, especially those horribly tragic arms in <em>Death and the Maiden</em>.

Another cozy dinner, this time at a place called Restaurant Fürich, and we talked about next year’s art project and dealing with faith with a blank slate while we ate pumpkin risotto, beef cheeks, and cheesecake with raspberry compote.

### Thursday, February 5
It’s an odd sensation to encounter the original thing that’s already known through a thousand photographs.Today I saw the Venus of Willendorf. Unlike the Mona Lisa, she was a little larger than I expected.
