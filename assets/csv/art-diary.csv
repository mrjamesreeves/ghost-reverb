Highlights,"Caravaggio, <em>Saint Jerome in His Study</em> (1606)","John Berger has said Caravaggio’s darkness “smells of candles, over-ripe melons, damp washing to be hung out the next day.” To me, it feels like the purple-black thoughts that burble within the midnight brain. And in this darkness, Jerome no longer belongs to history or dogma but to the silence he sought in the desert.",Rome,Galleria Borghese,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Jerome_Writing,
Highlights,"Lee Ufan, <em>Relatum-Silence</em> (2010)","At Naoshima, I was unexpectedly moved by a hunched boulder that appeared to pray before a glossy sheet of metal.",Naoshima,Lee Ufan Museum,https://benesse-artsite.jp/en/art/lee-ufan.html,ufan.jpg
Highlights,"Jusepe de Ribera, <em>Penitent Saint Peter</em> (1632)",A pentitent creature crying out in a void or maybe outerspace. These baroque paintings are the roots of film noir.,Chicago,Art Institute,https://www.artic.edu/artworks/120172/penitent-saint-peter,
,"Max Ernst, <em>Flowers on a Yellow Ground</em> (1929)",But the real action is the yellow shock of Max Ernst’s flowers,Vienna,Albertina,https://bsky.app/profile/jamesreeves.co/post/3mduusmvzak26,ernst-flowers.webp

Questions,"Franz Sedlacek, <em>Mountain Landscape with Automobile</em> (1931)","I was struck by a description of Sedlacek’s paintings as “representing nostalgic landscapes of the soul,” and their crispness gives his scenes a fairytale quality—which is odd because don’t memory and nostalgia tend be blurry?",Vienna,Albertina,https://sammlungenonline.albertina.at/en/objects/details/351377,
,"Anselm Feuerbach, <em>Medea</em> (1873)","The sorrowful grey skin, a stillness threatened by the mad violence across a vase.",Vienna,Leopold,https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/media/image/800/3834.jpg,
Questions,Moser’s exhibition posters,Perhaps the best use of stark geometries. But why do hard lines and perfect circles from 1902 feel so futuristic?,Vienna,Leopold,,
Highlights,Gustav Klimt,"For my money, Klimt’s masterpiece is his rendering of Judith with an expression so seductive and relaxed it’s defiant. The severed head she cradles becomes an afterthought. The stray dot of light in her eye and the glint of her teeth give the picture an almost sinister presence. Klimt’s work pulls off a rare feat: flat and graphic, entirely modern, yet drenched in mythic atmosphere and very much alive.",Vienna,Belvedere,https://www.belvedere.at/en/press/gustav-klimt-vienna-and-japan-1900,judith.jpg
Highlights,Tobias Pils,"Figures hunched in the murk,  maybe a two-and-a-half legged woman. Others squeeze their hair and still others fondle eggs. The roomy white space around these images becomes sinister because this is all Pils wants to show us.",Vienna,Museum moderner Kunst Wien,https://www.mumok.at/en/exhibitions/tobias-pils,
Highlights,Egon Schiele,"The tumbling drama of his <em>Blind Mother</em>. The eerie primary colors of Calvary. In Schiele’s canvases, color becomes sinister and murk feels like safety. From a letter to a friend in 1911, when he painted Revelation: “The oscillations of my astral light becoming faster, more abrupt, simpler, until…”",Vienna,Belvedere,https://www.belvedere.at/en/egon-schiele-0,

,"Robert Bechtle, <em>Berkley Pinto</em> (1976)","Painting as a photograph. You can feel the morning glare of the sun, the crisp spring air around the family heat.",Vienna,Museum moderner Kunst Wien,https://www.ludwig-stiftung.at/en/collection/work/berkeley-pinto-john-de-andrea-and-his-family-next-to-bechtles-car,bechtle.jpg
,"Laslo Moholy-Nagy, <em>Composition Q VIII</em> (1922)",There’s something so confident and cool about Moholy-Nagy’s <em>Composition Q VIII</em>. I think it’s the visual hiccup between the transluscent white panel and the jet black cross.,Vienna,Museum moderner Kunst Wien,,
,"Pieter Bruegel, <em>The Fight between Carnival and Lent</em> (1559)","Some big-budget Bruegel at the Kunsthistorische Museum: the high drama of the Procession to Calvary and the tower of Babel. Scenes of peasant feats, Solomon’s suicide, and hunters tromping through the snow. But most of all I was struck by <em>The Fight Between Carnival and Lent</em>, a scene of utter derangement that captures the blurred line between the sacred and profane.",Vienna,Das Kunsthistorische Museum,https://www.khm.at/en/artworks/the-fight-between-carnival-and-lent-320,
