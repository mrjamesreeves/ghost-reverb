Questions,"Franz Sedlacek, <em>Mountain Landscape with Automobile</em> (1931)","I was struck by a description of Sedlacek’s paintings as “representing nostalgic landscapes of the soul,” and their crispness gives his scenes a fairytale quality—which is odd because don’t memory and nostalgia tend be blurry?",Vienna,Albertina,https://sammlungenonline.albertina.at/en/objects/details/351377,
,"Anselm Feuerbach, <em>Medea</em> (1873)","The sorrowful grey skin, a stillness threatened by the mad violence across a vase.",Vienna,Leopold,https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/media/image/800/3834.jpg,
Questions,Moser’s exhibition posters,Perhaps the best use of stark geometries. But why do hard lines and perfect circles from 1902 feel so futuristic?,Vienna,Leopold,,
,Gustav Klimt,"his rendering of Judith with an expression so seductive, relaxed, and defiant that the severed head she cradles becomes an afterthought.",Vienna,Belvedere,https://www.belvedere.at/en/press/gustav-klimt-vienna-and-japan-1900,
Highlights,Tobias Pils,"Figures hunched in the murk,  maybe a two-and-a-half legged woman. Others squeeze their hair and still others fondle eggs. Somehow all the white space around these images becomes sinisiter, that this is *all* Pils wants to show us.",Vienna,Momac,,

,"Laslo Moholy-Nagy, <em>Composition Q VIII</em> (1922)",There’s something so confident and cool about Moholy-Nagy’s <em>Composition Q VIII</em>. I think it’s the visual hiccup between the transluscent white panel and the jet black cross.,Vienna,Momac,,
,"Pieter Bruegel, <em>The Fight between Carnival and Lent</em> (1559)","Some big-budget Bruegel at the Kunsthistorische Museum: the high drama of the Procession to Calvary and the tower of Babel.

But most of all I was struck by <em>The Fight Between Carnival and Lent</em>, a scene of utter derangement that captures the blurred line between the sacred and profane.",Vienna,Das Kunsthistorische Museum,https://www.khm.at/en/artworks/the-fight-between-carnival-and-lent-320,
